                                all of these are made possible through machine learning.
                                Over the past few years, this branch of artificial intelligence
                                (AI) has completely changed what’s possible with technology.<br>
                                <br>
                                But what exactly is machine learning?
                                Although many of us use it each and every day,
                                numerous people still can’t answer this question.
                                This post is designed to give you a brief overview
                                of this disruptive technology and how it works.</p>
                                <h2> 2) What Is Machine Learning?</h2>
                                <p>
                                As we’ve mentioned, machine learning is a subset of AI.
                                So, what’s AI? Well, AI’s actually a subset of computer science!
                                It specifically deals with creating computer systems
                                that can perform tasks as well as or better than human beings.<br>
                                <br>
                                Machine learning takes things a step further.
                                 As its name implies, it focuses on teaching machines how to learn. 
                                 Put another way, it’s a data analysis method that automates analytical model building.
                                By feeding a machine system the right data in the right way,
                                it can learn from this data, identify patterns,
                                and even make decisions without human intervention.
                                </p>
                                <h2> 3) Machine Learning’s Evolution</h2>
                               <p>Machine learning has actually been around for decades.
                                 It was born from the idea that computers could learn 
                                 without being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks.
                                All the machine would need is some data to train
                                off of and superb pattern recognition capabilities.<br>
                                <br>
                                The iterative aspect of machine learning cannot be emphasized enough.
                                By training machine learning models over and over (and then some)
                                and exposing them to new data, they’re able to independently adapt.
                                This repetition is what eventually leads to reliable results.<br>
                                <br>
                                By this point, a certain question is probably bugging
                                you: If machine learning has been around for a quite a while,
                                why has it recently exploded in popularity? Because 
                                of the ability to automatically apply complex mathematical
                                calculations to big data rapidly — this is a fairly recent development.<br>
                                <br>
                                With cheaper and more powerful computing resources than ever before, 
                                we’re able to accelerate the repetitive training necessary
                                 for machines to become competent in certain tasks.
                                 This is why methods similar to machine learning 
                                 like data mining and Bayesian analysis have also grown in popularity.<br>
                                 <br>
                                 Better computing systems and more affordable data storage means
                                machine learning is no longer restricted to tech 
                                developers in San Francisco. Now, we can all analyze
                                and act upon bigger, more complex data and deliver faster,
                                more accurate results. In turn, organizations from fields like healthcare,
                                transportation, finance, and more can all leverage
                                 machine learning to identify profitable opportunities and address longstanding problems.<br>
                                 <br>
                                 How Machine Learning Works
                                To build the best machine learning systems possible,
                                you have to pair the right algorithms with
                                the right tools and processes. Here are the main factors to consider:<br>
                                <br>
                                <ul>

                                    <li class="m">Algorithms</li>
                                    <li class="m">Automation processes</li>
                                    <li class="m">Scalability</li>
                                </ul>
                                The two most popular types of machine learning methods
                                 are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
                                 Let’s briefly cover the ones everyone should know a little bit about:<br>
                                
                                 <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
                                For this method, algorithms are trained with labeled examples,
                                where the desired output is known for an input.
                                Here’s an example: Let’s say you have some testing equipment
                                that has data points labeled with either “F” for “failure” or “R” for “runs.”
                                We then feed this data in the form of inputs and outputs to a learning algorithm.
                                After this, the algorithm compares actual output with correct outputs to elucidate any errors.
                                It then modifies the machine learning model accordingly.<br>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
